# Cincinnati 311 (Non-Emergency) Service Requests Dashboard (Power BI)
## Introduction
This project analyzes service requests in Cincinnati to identify trends, response times, and geographical hotspots using Power BI. The database connection is available to the public and is provided by Cincinnati through OData. Power BI was used for the entire data connection, transformation, and visualization process. The project revealed a number of insights. Most requests remain open and exceed estimated resolution times. Certain departments handle far more requests than others: Public Services often handles more requests than the other departments combined, and is followed in request volume by Cincinnati Building Department, Department of Transport and Energy, the City Manager's Office, and the Police Department.

Some anomalies existed in the dataset. Some requests had an "update time" that preceded the filing of the request, in some cases by months. A few select requests related to areas outside of the Cincinnati area. All anomalies were ignored for analysis. There were also issues relating to Power BI failing to recognize certain zip codes; such issues were resolved by pairing the zip code with latitude and longitude data, which exists in the database.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset is sourced from Cincinnatiâ€™s public 311 OData feed, which provides detailed information about service requests. Below are some key features of the dataset:

Dataset Details
Source: Cincinnati OData feed (311 service requests).
Number of Records: Over 1,300,000 rows.

Key Columns:
STATUS: Current status of the service request (NEW, OPEN, PEND, CLOS).
REQUESTED_DATETIME and UPDATED_DATETIME: Timestamps for request creation and updates.
SERVICE_NAME: Type of service requested (e.g., Pothole Repair, Garbage Pickup).
AGENCY_RESPONSIBLE: Department that will handle the 311 request.
ZIPCODE: Geographical location of the request.
LATITUDE, LONGITUDE: Exact location of request.

Challenges
Blank Columns: Certain columns such as STATUS_NOTES, SERVICE_NOTICE, and ADDRESS_ID were consistently blank and excluded from the analysis.
Negative Resolution Times: Instances where UPDATED_DATETIME predates REQUESTED_DATETIME highlight data quality issues.
Duplicate Timestamps: Many rows have identical REQUESTED_DATETIME and UPDATED_DATETIME, limiting time-based insights for these entries.
